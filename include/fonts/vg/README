README

This directory contains some fonts, which can be used with OpenVG.

If you want to use your own fonts, do the following:

1. Copy the .ttf file of the font(s) temporarily into this directory.

2. If the base file name of a font file contains characters, which are not
allowed in C-identifiers, you have to rename the file and replace this
character, because the name is used to create such identifiers.

3. Enter "make" to make the font converter tool. You need the Freetype2 library
on your host machine, so that this can be done.

4. Given that the name of the font file is SomeFont.ttf, enter the following
command to create the font header file to be included into your application:

	make SomeFont.h

5. Now the font can be included in your application and a font object can be
created from it:

	#include <graphics/vgfont.h>
	#include <fonts/vg/SomeFont.h>

	SomeFunction()
	{
		CVgFont SomeFont20 (MAKE_FONT (SomeFont, 20.0f));

		...
	}
