README

This directory contains some fonts, which can be used with OpenVG.

If you want to use your own fonts, do the following:

1. Copy the .ttf file of the font(s) into this directory.

2. If the base file name of a font file contains characters, which are not
allowed in C-identifiers, you have to rename the file and replace this
character, because the name is used to create such identifiers.

3. Now build the whole project as usual from project root:

	./makeall clean
	./makeall

This converts the .ttf files in this directory to .h font header files. You need
the Freetype2 library installed on your host machine, so that the font converter
tool can be built. This is not required for the default fonts included in the
project.

4. Given that the name of the font file was SomeFont.ttf, you can include the
font in your application and a font object can be created from it:

	#include <graphics/vgfont.h>
	#include <fonts/vg/SomeFont.h>

	SomeFunction()
	{
		CVgFont SomeFont20 (MAKE_FONT (SomeFont, 20.0f));

		...
	}
